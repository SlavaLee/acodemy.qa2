Dendy or Nes (Nintendo Entertainment System) was so popular that to market came some Pirated clones of NES and Unlicensed games!  
Pirated clones not always were fully tested and could have critical errors.  
Famiclone games were cheap and affordable, many of them contained several games, unlike original licensed cartridges, up to 52 in one or maybe even more (with no repeats).  
But of course there were also downsides: plastic shells were cheaply built and broke often; sometimes labels on a case did not correspond the contents of a cartridge; cartridge like "9999-in-1" actually contained about ninja gaiden10 very simple and very common games from the early.

After 8 bit consoles i had 16 bit [Sega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega/) and than [Playstation 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)) ( *PS* ).  
Every game had their own features and i loved to find them. Spending nearly whole day i was playing games.  
When i was playing [C-12 ](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mBL0O0fYM8E/maxresdefault.jpg) on PS1 there was a Boss which i can't kill. I tried so many times but ended same way - battle was lost.  
Once i found a way how to kill it. It was i defect in a door , so door to the Boss was closed but from one point you can shoot through the door and do some dmg to Boss.
Boss was knocked out easily and that was my happy end.
